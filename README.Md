# MCU Emulator

## Overview

This project provides an emulator for a new Microcontroller Unit (MCU) currently under development.

Before the MCU is officially released to the market, partner companies and developers require a simulation environment to pre-develop and test software applications compatible with the upcoming hardware. This emulator serves as a virtual platform that replicates the behavior of the MCU, enabling early-stage development and validation.

## Key Features

- Simulates key functionalities of the upcoming MCU
- Enables firmware and application development prior to hardware availability
- Provides a stable environment for testing and debugging
- Helps reduce time-to-market for products built on the new MCU

## Usage

Developers can use this emulator to:

- Run and test embedded applications
- Simulate I/O behavior and peripheral responses
- Debug code in an environment that closely mirrors the actual MCU

## Target Audience

- Embedded system developers
- Partner companies integrating with the new MCU
- Firmware and toolchain developers

## Notes

- This emulator is intended for development and testing purposes only.
- Final behavior may vary slightly depending on the actual MCU hardware implementation.
